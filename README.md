# Simple FS Abstraction

This typescript library provides a highly simplified interface for a file system: paths, files and directories, and that is it. No symlinks, no hardlinks. Intended to be backed by implementations for different typescript runtimes (or runtime-agnostic in-memory backends for non-persistent use-cases).
